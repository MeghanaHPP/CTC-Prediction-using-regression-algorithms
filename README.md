# CTC-Prediction-using-regression-algorithms
Problem Statement: The objective is to predict CTC of various employees coming from various backgrounds. The datasets of several predictor (independent) variables and one target variable (charges)  

Dataset Information:Â¶
College: A categorical data which tells if the college falls under Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3(object) 2) Role: Manager or Executive (object)
City type: Metropolitan or non-metropolitan city (object)
Previous CTC: The previous salary of the candidate (float)
Previous job changes: Number of jobs the person has changed before joining this company (int)
Graduation marks: Marks obtained (int)
Exp(Months): Work Experience in months (int)

Three models, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor are built and the best performing model is further enhanced. Random Forest was the best model for prediction here. 

Although, the results were not so satisfactory since the independent variables did not show a strong relation with the target variable.
